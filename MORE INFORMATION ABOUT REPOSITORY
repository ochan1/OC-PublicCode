This is a public version of a Private Source that I have. It consists of files that I have used to learn Swift.

There are private projects that I created that are a combination of what I learned.
If you would like to see them, please contact me with the email you received with my application with your Git username,
as there are projects I hope to ship.

One of my private projects: Carpool College (iOS App Store): https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/carpool-college/id1274771369?ls=1&mt=8&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3Bdp%2FldwqNTf2U6AqmSm0ypw%3D%3D
