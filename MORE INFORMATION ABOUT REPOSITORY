This is a public version of a Private Source that I have. It consists of files that I have used to learn Swift.

There are private projects that I created that are a combination of what I learned.
If you would like to see them, please contact me with the email you received with my application with your Git username,
as there are projects I hope to ship.

You may also contact me on LinkedIn if you wish (just don't stalk me): https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscar-c-6ba205139/
